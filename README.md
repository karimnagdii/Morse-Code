# Morse Code Encryption and Decryption

This Python program allows users to encrypt English phrases into Morse code and decrypt Morse code back into English phrases. It uses a dictionary mapping English characters and digits to their respective Morse code representations. The program handles both encryption and decryption, offering a simple and effective way to convert messages between English and Morse code.

## Examples

1. **Encryption Example:**
   ```bash
   Enter 'E' for encryption or 'D' for decryption: E
   Enter the English phrase to encrypt: Hello World
   Morse Code: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
1. **Decryption Example:**
